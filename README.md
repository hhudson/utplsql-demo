# Write Unit Tests to document functionality


This repo is published as an artifact of [Episode 65 of the APEX Instant Tips series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5slqOfzi_oM) and was inspired by Pesse's excellent blog post [Let Tests Tell a Story With utPLSQL Nested Contexts](https://cleandatabase.wordpress.com/2019/12/02/let-tests-tell-a-story-with-utplsql-nested-contexts/).

In this repo you will find:
- [an example package that documents the CDC's guidance](packages/cdc_guidance.pks)
- [an utplsql package that merely tries to prevent regression](packages/test_cdc_guidance.pks)
- [an utplsql package that serves as an FAQ for the CDC's guidance](packages/ut_days_to_separate.pks)

This repo is templated off of the Insum Start Template.
